We are actively looking for new members to join our research team. 

If you are interested in the following opportunities, please contact [Jiaxiang Zhang](mailto:zhangj73@cardiff.ac.uk) with your CV for further information.

### Post-doctoral fellowships
One 3-year post-doctoral fellowship is available to work on a [ERC](https://erc.europa.eu)-funded project. The research fellow will use multimodal brain imaging (7T BOLD-fMRI/MRS/dMRI) to investigate the neurobiological and neurochemical mechanisms of decision-making.

### PhD studentships
We consider applications for PhD studentships on a rolling basis, with a typical starting date in October. Deadlines vary between November and March, depending on funding schemes. We recommend students to get in contact to discuss potential projects before making application.

### Visitors and interns
We welcome academic visitors from anywhere in the world to join us on a temporary basis, either for developing new collaborations or, for students, to gain new research skills. Previously, we hosted visitors and students from China, Italy and Spain, and our experience has been hugely positive.
