### PhD studentships
We consider applications for PhD studentships on a rolling basis, with a typical starting date in October. Deadlines vary between November and March, depending on funding schemes. We recommend students to get in contact to discuss potential projects before making application.

### Visitors and interns
We welcome academic visitors from anywhere in the world to join us on a temporary basis, either for developing new collaborations or, for students, to gain new research skills. Previously, we hosted visitors and students from China, Italy and Spain, and our experience has been hugely positive.
