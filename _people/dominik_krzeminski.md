# Brief bio
Dominik graduated from the University of Warsaw in 2016. During his studies he investigated visual system and power-law scaling in the brain. He was also an Erasmus exchange student at the Bernstein Centre for Computational Neuroscience in Berlin and worked as a Research Assistant in the Laboratory of Brain Imaging at the Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology in Warsaw. His scientific interests lie in the intersection of machine-learning and cognitive science, in particular decision making. He is now working on the project: "Optimal decoding of spatiotemporal patterns in Magnetoencephalography (MEG)".
