# Brief bio
I graduated from the University of Manchester with a BSc in Pharmacology with Industrial Experience in 2019. Over 2017/18, I completed a 12-month biology placement at Eli Lilly, where my research focused on developing novel in vivo models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related tauopathies. During my industrial placement and multiple projects at university, I developed a particular interest the mechanisms underpinning the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD and Parkinson’s disease (PD).
My PhD project is supervised by Dr Paul Dodson and Dr Jiaxiang Zhang and is titled: ‘encoding of decision making by dopamine neurons’, relating to PD and tauopathies such as progressive supranuclear palsy. I use in vivo behavioural testing, electrophysiological recording and computational modelling to further characterise sub-populations of dopamine neurons involved in decision making and impulsive choices.
