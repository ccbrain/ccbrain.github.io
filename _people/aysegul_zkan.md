# Brief bio

I received my BSc degree in Electrical-Electronics Engineering from Erciyes University, Kayseri, Turkey. I also completed my second BSc degree in Biomedical Engineering as a double major from the same university. After that, I received my MSc degree in Cognitive Neuroscience from the University of Nottingham. My research interest is focused on neuroimaging and understanding the neural mechanisms of memory based decision making.
