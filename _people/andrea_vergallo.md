# Brief bio

I completed my studies in medicine and neurology/neuroscience at the University of Pisa (Italy). This was followed by a 2.5-year research fellowship at Sorbonne University, where I was involved in Alzheimerâ€™s multi-modal biomarkers clinical investigation. Increasing research interest in network-wise neuroimaging approaches for age/genetic-related cognitive and behavioural impairment motivates the current Ph.D. fellowship at Cardiff University.
