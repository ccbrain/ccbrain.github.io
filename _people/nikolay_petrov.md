# Brief bio

I got my BSc in Psychology from the University of Greenwich in 2020 and due to finish my MSc in Psychological Research Methods from the University of Oxford in 2021. I have been involved in a variety of different projects, ranging from [psychometrics](https://nikolaybpetrov.com/portfolio-items/psychometric-development-and-validation-of-the-developmental-crisis-questionnaire-dcq/), [dreams](https://nikolaybpetrov.com/portfolio-items/dreams-project/), [face recognition](https://nikolaybpetrov.com/portfolio-items/the-effect-of-face-masks-and-sunglasses-on-identity-and-expression-recognition-with-superrecognisers-and-typical-observers/), [statistics](https://nikolaybpetrov.com/portfolio-items/open-source-software-for-applying-multiple-tests-corrections-and-generating-apa-formatted-tables/), spatial research. My MSc thesis is focusing on information-seeking, decision-making and curiosity, which is the theme of the work I am involved in within Cardiff. More information about me can be found on my [personal website](https://nikolaybpetrov.com).
