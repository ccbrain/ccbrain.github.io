My background is in mathematical and computational modelling. I completed a Masters in Maths and Physics at The University of Warwick before joining the Mathematics of Real-World Systems CDT for my MSc and PhD. During my PhD I developed Markov chain models of molecular dynamics within presynaptic terminals, tightly constrained to biophysical data and implemented in a stochastic simulation framework. Primarily I modelled the dynamics of voltage-gated calcium channels carrying the migraine mutation S218L and explored possible architectures of the synaptic vesicle fusion machinery. I am now interested in modelling cognitive behaviours at higher spatial scales, including with machine learning methods, while maintaining tight constraints with experimental data.
