# Brief bio
I received my BSc in Computer Science at Cardiff University, during which I completed a year in industry working with Technocamps to promote technical learning in schools and colleges. Then I completed a MSc in Advanced Computer Science at Swansea University, which is when my interests expanded from human-computer interaction to include Artificial Intelligence, and I completed my dissertation on Human Activity Recognition using Graph Learning. I was fortunate to be able to join the EPSRC CDT for Human-Centred AI at Swansea, and my PhD project is focused on developing an explainable and adaptive AI model for predicting the profiles of patients attending NHS Emergency Departments, supervised by Prof. Jiaxiang Zhang and Dr. Alma Rahat.
