# Brief bio
I received my BSoSc degree in Psychology in the Education University of Hong Kong with a concentration on the health psychology. Then I received the MSc degree in neuroimaging from Cardiff University. After the graduation, I took a gap year and worked as a RA in the Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Science where I engaged in multiple studies on athletes and mainly focused on the data processing of structural and resting state fMRI data. Now I am studying as a PhD student in the lab and my research interest is about the cognitive and neural mechanism of voluntary decision/choice in humans.
