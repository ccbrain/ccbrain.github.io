# Brief bio
I completed my undergraduate degree in Biochemistry and Genetics at Swansea University before gaining experience in various roles, including behavioral technician, academic note-taker, among others. Along the way, I developed a strong enthusiasm for coding and began taking courses, which led me to an exciting opportunity to combine my background with computer science through the CDT program. Now, as a PhD student, I am continuing my studies bringing together healthcare and computer science to drive meaningful advancements in the field.
