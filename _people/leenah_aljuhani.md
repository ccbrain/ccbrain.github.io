# Brief bio
I graduated with a BSc in Computer Science, specializing in Artificial Intelligence, from Jeddah University in 2020, and later completed an MSc in Artificial Intelligence from King Faisal University in 2024. My research experience includes leveraging Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and time series data analysis for healthcare solutions, with a focus on AI-driven applications, Internet of Things (IoT), data analysis, and network transmission security. For my Ph.D., I am working on medical imaging under the supervision of Prof. Jiaxiang Zhang and Dr. Joe Macinnes.
