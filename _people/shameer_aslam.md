# Brief bio
I did my BTech in Electronics and Communication Engineering (THDC IHET, Tehri, India) and MTech in Signal Processing (National Institute of Technology, Calicut, India). Thereafter, I worked in Amrita Advanced Centre for Epilepsy (AACE, India) for 5 years as a research fellow. My role was to help the clinic with medial image processing tools in presurgical evaluation of epilepsy patients. I am interested in medical imaging and biomedical signal processing.
