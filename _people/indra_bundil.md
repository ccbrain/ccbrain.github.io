# Brief bio

I completed a BSc in Business Psychology (Osnabrueck University of Applied Sciences, Germany) and a MSc in Psychology (Dresden Technical University, Germany). During my master's degree, I worked on studies examining decision making under uncertainty and sequential decision making. Here at CUBRIC, I investigate the characteristics and longitudinal changes of information processing speed and its neural correlates as part of my PhD project.
