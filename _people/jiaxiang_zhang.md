# Brief bio
I did my undergraduate training in computer science in China, and completed my PhD in computational neuroscience with [Prof. Rafal Bogacz](https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/team/rafal-bogacz) at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk). This was followed by a post-doctoral post in [Prof. Zoe Kourtzi's lab](https://www.abg.psychol.cam.ac.uk) at the University of Birmingham, where I started to learn brain imaging and human cognition. I was then an investigator scientist in [Prof. James Rowe's lab](http://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/directory/profile.php?jamesrowe) at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit (the ["CBU"](https://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk)) in Cambridge, where I became interested in human voluntary control. In 2015, I joined Cardiff University as a faculty member at [CUBRIC](https://sites.cardiff.ac.uk/cubric) in the [School of Psychology](http://psych.cf.ac.uk). In 2022, I joined Swansea University as a Professor of Artificial Intelligence in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/compsci/).
