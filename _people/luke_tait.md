# Brief bio
I graduated with an MMath in Mathematical Physics from the University of Liverpool in 2015. Subsequently, I did a PhD in Mathematics at the University of Exeter Living System’s Institute, supervised by Dr Marc Goodfellow and Dr Jon Brown (submitted in 2019). The focus on my PhD research was using techniques from maths and physics (data analysis, graph theory, non-linear dynamical systems theory) to analyse and computationally model multi-scaled electrophysiological data to understand neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease. This work was part of an Alzheimer’s Society funded Doctoral Training Centre. 

I joined the Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre in July 2019 as a Research Associate, integrating functional imaging (fMRI, MEG) and computational modelling to understand the neuronal mechanisms underpinning decision making.
