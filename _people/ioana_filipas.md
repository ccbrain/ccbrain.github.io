# Brief bio
I have finished my 1st year at Cardiff University as a psychology undergraduate student. I am currently an intern at CUBRIC in a research project involving confirmation bias and perceptual decision making. I am interested in gaining more insight into different areas of psychology throughout my degree, but I have a particular interest in understanding the underlying processes of cognition, how these impact human behaviour and what can it tell us about differences among individuals, especially when it comes to biases, or mental health problems.
