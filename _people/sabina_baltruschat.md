During my BSc in Psychology (University Jaime I, Castell√≥n de la Plana, Spain) I started working with neuroimaging techniques and I decided to study a MSc in Behavioural and Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Granada (Granada, Spain). I completed my PhD and a postdoctoral fellowship in the Research Group Learning, Emotion, Decisions (University of Granada), where my research was focused on risk-taking in traffic environments.
Currently I am interested in research on neural correlates of decision-making and related cognitive processes and the integration of different neuroimaging techniques (EEG, MEG, and fMRI) and behavioural models.

<!--Sabina visited us in 2017 to help set up an EEG study, in which she examined people's intentional decisions with rewards. Sabina likes us so much that she visited again in 2018 for a collaborative project on risk taking behaviour.-->
