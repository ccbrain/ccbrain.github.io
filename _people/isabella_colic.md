# Brief bio
I graduated with a BSc in Psychological Sciences and Techniques at the University of Bologna in 2018 and then went on to receive a MSc in Cognitive Science at the University of Trento in July 2020. I have worked on visual working memory and magnetoencephalography (MEG) during my MSc but I have always been fascinated by decision-making processes, which will be the focus of my PhD thesis at Cardiff University.
