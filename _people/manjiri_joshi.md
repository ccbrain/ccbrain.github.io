# Brief bio
I completed my Undergraduate studies from SGGS College of Engineering and Technology Nanded, India. After graduating, I worked in Developmental Informatics Lab at IIT Bombay, Mumbai for a few years. Next, I worked with the IDID Lab at Industrial Design Center.
I started the MSc+PhD program in Computational Foundry in September 2022. As part of my PhD I am currently exploring how ageing-in place is being supported in different countries.
