# Brief bio
I completed a BSc in Nuclear Science and Materials at the University of Birmingham in 2016. Whilst working after my undergraduate degree I developed an interest in AI and Deep Learning so decided to change fields and completed a MSc in Computer Science at Swansea University in 2021. It was during this I decided I wanted to pursue a PhD and learned about the HCAI CDT here which I was delighted to be able join, and completed the MSc in Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence as part of the program in March 2023. Since then, I have been investigating using computer vision for detecting cancer in digital pathology images for my PhD supervised by Prof Jiaxiang Zhang and Dr Mike Edwards.
