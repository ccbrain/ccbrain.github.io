### Best programming practices for open science

Last Friday (May 25th, 2018) two of the PhD students from our lab, [Dominik](/people/dominik_krzeminski) and [Maciej](/people/maciej_szul), organised the workshop [Best programming practices for open science](https://sciprogramming.wordpress.com/) under the wings of GW4. 

This one-day training targeted all post-graduate students who are using programming in their daily work for numerical simulations, data processing or statistical modelling.

The experts and advocates of open source scientific software demonstrated practical solutions on how to make the academic code more accessible to other users and how to improve reproducibility of the results. The workshop addressed new developments in programming workflow that could be applied across disciplines. Dr Vincent Knight and Nikoleta E. Glynatsi from Cardiff University School of Mathematics presented tips on how to increase code readability and reliability. They opened our eyes on code testing, comments and variables/function naming conventions. Dr Cyril Charron from CUBRIC presented arguments in favour of using distributed version control systems. Participants could practice it during next GIT hands-on session. Next, we went beyond coding with Dr Daniel Finnegan from University of Bath, who presented useful tools for scientific writing (LaTeX) and reference managing (Mendeley, Zotero). Last but not least Dr Candice Morey shared her experiences on how to log and structure the academic project using tools like OSF.

According to the feedback forms received, participants had mostly positive impressions from the course. The workshop was full of networking, discussions and interesting questions. That gives a lot of hope that we managed to encourage young researchers to take care about the quality of their code, which might lead to the more robust scientific results.
