2017 is quickly coming to an end. We finally got a chance to get (almost) everyone together for a photo (and some nice food). A lot happened this year. Thanks to various funding sources, a few excellent [new lab members](/people) joined in, and they are now on several interlinked projects. We are also sad to say goodbye to [Jacopo](/people/jacopo_barone), who joined us in 2016 as an intern and later as a RA. Jacopo did a wonderful job in completing behavioural and EEG experiment(s) in free choices under uncertainty. We wish him all the best in his new research post in London.

Looking forward to 2018, we aim to focus on three priorities.

### 1. Clear the desk
This is **_not_** about keeping our office desks tidy (well, maybe we [should](https://www.cleverism.com/clean-desk-policy-drives-productivity-creativity/), or [should not](https://ideas.ted.com/why-every-office-should-scrap-its-clean-desk-policy/)), but to bring completed projects to closure, with new follow-ups if necessary. Everyone is excited to initiate a new study (who isn't!), but (e.g., myself) often less so  on something we did three years or even three months ago. In 2018, we will try to slim down our file drawers as much as possible, meaning to publish or preprint current drafts, including null findings, analysis scripts and stimulus.

### 2. See the wood for the trees
Clearing the desk frees up mental capacity. It will naturally be devoted to new adventures: new paradigms, new equipment, new collaborations, (sometimes) new grants, ... (did I mention that this is exciting?). We however need to maintain a clear mind on the big scientific questions, which fundamentally interests us. Incremental or independent studies are critical to drive science forward, but may get lost if they are not signposted to a big question. 

Of course, your research interests may differ from other lab members (hopefully not too far apart). The key is to frequently review them, and whether they are consistent with your current work. For PhD students, this will help deliver a coherent thesis. For research fellows, this will help shape your future independence. For the PI, well, this will help me not become [multi-armed Avalokitesvara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalokite%C5%9Bvara#Thousand-armed_Avalokite%C5%9Bvara), hopping between projects. To make this emphasis, in 2018, we will discuss long-term plans for every new experiment or grant proposal, and not be satisfied solely by "a possible 4* paper" (oh and yes, we still love them).

### 3. Fusion and integration
We are based in [an imaging centre](https://sites.cardiff.ac.uk/cubric) that excels in integration and collaboration. Many of our ongoing studies benefit from our collaborators' strong support (advice/resource/expertise). In 2018, we will continue the dedication to these successful collaborations. Meanwhile, we now have a diverse set of skills in the lab, enabling joint forces on multi-modal imaging. New projects will probe how this approach facilitates imaging-behavioural integration in understanding decision and action the human brain.
