A new paper by our previous and current members is published in Communications Biology. In this study, we systematically characterized the relationship between brain connectivity variability and grey matter/white matter tissue microstructure.

Humans differ from each other in a wide range of biometrics, but to what extent brain connectivity varies between individuals remains largely unknown. By combining diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), this study characterizes the inter-subject variability (ISV) of multimodal brain connectivity. Structural connectivity is characterized by higher ISV in association cortices including the core multiple-demand network and lower ISV in the sensorimotor cortex. MEG ISV exhibits frequency-dependent signatures, and the extent of MEG ISV is consistent with that of structural connectivity ISV in selective macroscopic cortical clusters. Across the cortex, the ISVs of structural connectivity and beta-band MEG functional connectivity are negatively associated with cortical myelin content indexed by the quantitative T1 relaxation rate measured by high-resolution 7â€‰T MRI. Furthermore, MEG ISV from alpha to gamma bands relates to the hindrance and restriction of the white-matter tissue estimated by DWI microstructural models. Our findings depict the inter-relationship between the ISV of brain connectivity from multiple modalities, and highlight the role of tissue microstructure underpinning the ISV.

The paper is now available [online](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-03974-w).
