A new paper led by Dominik is published.

We combined cognitive modelling and neural-mass modelling to characterise the neurocognitive process underlying perceptual decision-making with single or double information sources. Ninety-four human participants performed binary decisions to discriminate the coherent motion direction averaged across two independent apertures. Regardless of the angular distance of the apertures, separating motion information into two apertures resulted in a reduction in accuracy. Our cognitive and neural-mass modelling results are consistent with the hypotheses that the addition of the second information source led to a lower signal-to-noise ratio of evidence accumulation with two congruent information sources, and a change in the decision strategy of speedâ€“accuracy trade-off with two incongruent sources. Thus, our findings support a robust behavioural change in relation to multiple information sources, which have congruency-dependent impacts on selective decision-making subcomponents.

The paper is now available [online](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13414-021-02434-7).
