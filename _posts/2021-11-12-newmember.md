Everyone has been busy in the last few weeks with various projects. We however managed to have a face-to-face get-together. The first is to welcome our new Research Fellow [Sabina Baltruschat](/people/sabina_baltruschat) and PhD student [Andrea Vergallo](/people/andrea_vergallo). Sabina will work on MRI/MEG decision-making projects. Andrea’s PhD will focus on brain network changes in people with genetic risks of developing Alzheimer’s disease.

We also say goodbye to [Marinho](http://malopes.yolasite.com). Marinho joined us in 2019 and has made substantial achievements in his work on the mathematical modelling of epileptic seizures with MEG and stereo-EEG data. Marinho will still collaborate closely on ongoing projects, and we wish Marinho all the best for his future adventures.
