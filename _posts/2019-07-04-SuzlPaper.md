A new paper by [Maciej Szul](/people/maciej_szul) and our collaborators is published on Behavior Research Methods. By comparing behavioural performance and cognitive model parameters, Maciej showed that joystick movements revealed comparable decision-making processes as conventional key presses in perceptual decision-making. The results pave the way for our further action-centric paradigms for decision making.

The paper is now available [online](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-019-01269-3).
