A new paper led by [Marinho Lopes](/people/marinho_lopes) is published on Clinical Neurophysiology. The study applied the brain network ictogenicity framework to quantify the inherent propensity to generate seizures from resting-state MEG recordings. We found that resting-state MEG functional networks from people with epilepsy are characterized by a higher propensity to generate seizures than those from healthy volunteers, with a classification accuracy of 73%. This sensitive computational modelling approach could in future aid diagnosis.

The paper is now available [online](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1388245721000316).
