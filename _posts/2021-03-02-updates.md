We carry on our research while everyone has adapted to work from home. Dominik has passed his PhD viva, a big achievement in a challenging year. Big congratulations Dr Krzeminski! Luke has started his new job at the University of Birmingham while maintains our close collaborations on several ongoing projects. We really appreciate their important contributions in the last few years and wish them all the best in their future careers.
