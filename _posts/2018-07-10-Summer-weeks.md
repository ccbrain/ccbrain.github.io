The past few weeks have been busy. We enjoyed the [OHBM annual meeting](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageID=3821) in Singapore, packed with interesting food, tropical fruits, humid heat, and of course excellent science. The lab members presented four posters from our ongoing projects. It is nice to see them coming closer to the finishing line.

In Krakow, we organized a symposium at the [ASSC annual meeting](http://theassc.org/assc-22), in which we emphasized that that voluntary action paradigms, or forced choice between similar options, can be a powerful tool to investigate endogenous factors that influence decision-making processes. 

We welcome our new PhD student [Aysegul](/people/aysegul_zkan), who started this month and is interested in value/memory-based decision-making.

We are also sad to say goodbye to [Beth](/people/bethany_routley). Beth completed her fellowship at CUBRIC and started new adventure as a science communication officer. We wish Beth all the best in her new role!
