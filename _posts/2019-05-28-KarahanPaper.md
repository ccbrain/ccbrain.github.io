A new paper by [Esin Karahan](/people/esin_karahan) and our collaborators is published on the Journal of Neuroscience. We showed that higher DWI-based neurite density in the corticospinal tract is negatively associated with action speed in a simple reaction time task. This results confirmed the common assumption that the non-decision time is rooted in the primary motor pathway of the brain. We put forward a simple analysis [pipeline](https://github.com/esinkarahan/ATA) to search for structural-functional associations along the principal direction of fiber bundles, which would be useful in further studies on anatomically specific brain-behaviour associations.

The paper is now available [online](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2019/05/23/JNEUROSCI.2954-18.2019).
