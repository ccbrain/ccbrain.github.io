Do you receive questions from your friends and family what exactly you are doing in science? When you want to respond, do you have the temptation to use words "MR, MEG, computational models etc" which do not make much sense in daily life? Then, you may consider devising new ways to explain yourself without technical terminology. 

Last week, [Esin](/people/esin_karahan) spoke on the [Soapbox Science event](http://soapboxscience.org/soapbox-science-2019-cardiff) in Cardiff City centre. [Soapbox Science](http://soapboxscience.org) provides a platform for scientists to explain their research to the general public on streets (without computers!). Esin talked about her work titled "How and when do we make decisions? Trace back from behaviour and brain." She met with people, young, old, as well as little ones, who are enthusiastic about the human brain. We have received many positive feedback, including volunteers interested in participating our ongoing experiments. Well done!
