## 1. Analysis scripts

**1.1. Along Tract Analysis of diffusion-weighted imaging data**

This is an analysis pipeline for searching structural-functional associations along the principal direction of fiber bundles.

\[[Script repository](https://github.com/esinkarahan/ATA)\]

\[[Reference: Karahan et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2954-18.2019)\]

**1.2. Automatic localization of multiple high density depth electrodes**

\[[Script repository](https://github.com/ccbrain/sEEG)\]

**1.3. A cortical atlas (230 ROIs) optimized for MEG**

This atlas is reduced from the Human Connectome Project's multimodal parcellation. This atlas is optimized for MEG based upon the forward transformation between source dynamics and MEG sensors.

\[[Script repository](https://github.com/lukewtait/evaluate_inverse_methods)\]
